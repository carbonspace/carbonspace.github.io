# Welcome

<img src="/assets/img/dm-massive.png" alt="Dwight Lee Maskew" width="150" align="left">I'm Dwight. Thanks for stopping by. 

I create and enhance user interfaces and components for interactive platforms with a focus on pragmatic UI/UX design.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/carbonspace/carbonspace.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
